# Autonomous System for Disaster Response: Navigating and Mapping Hazardous Environments

## Objective 

The goal of this project is to design and implement a complete autonomous system to perform reconnaissance in a simulated disaster environment

1. **Environment Mapping:** Autonomously generate a detailed occupancy grid map of the unknown environment, aiding in the visualization of the area and planning of safe navigation paths.

2. **Victim Location:** Detect simulated victims represented by AprilTags within the environment, providing their ID numbers and precise locations relative to the map.
